# Asymptotic notation

## Time complexity

### Big O - upper bound

> Describes how fast or slow an algorithm is

O(n^2) - quadradic
O(n log n) - n log n
O(n) - linear
O(log n) - logrithmic
O(1) - constant number of steps, in this case one step total

## omega - lower bound

if using omega symbol - it means "it might take as few as" those steps

Ω(1) - can be binary or linear if we get lucky

### theta

Θ - if big O and omega are the same - we can say they're in theta of n

## Space Complexity
