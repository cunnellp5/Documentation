# Quick live guide

## Requirement Gathering and Clarification:

Understand the problem statement and requirements.
Ask clarifying questions to gather more information.
Define the scope of the system.

## Functional Requirements:

Identify the primary functionalities the system needs to provide.
Prioritize features based on importance and impact.

## Non-functional Requirements:

Determine scalability, reliability, availability, performance, and security requirements.
Consider factors like latency, throughput, data consistency, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery.

## High-Level Design:

Design the system architecture at a high level.
Identify major components/modules and their interactions.
Choose appropriate technologies and frameworks.

## Data Storage:

Design the data storage model.
Choose the type of databases (SQL, NoSQL, key-value stores, etc.).
Consider data partitioning, indexing, sharding, and replication strategies.

## System Components:

Design individual components of the system, such as frontend, backend, caching layer, load balancer, message queues, etc.
Define responsibilities of each component.
Consider microservices architecture if applicable.

## Communication Between Components:

Define protocols and APIs for communication between components.
Consider synchronous and asynchronous communication.
Discuss message formats and serialization/deserialization.

## Scalability and Performance:

Design for horizontal and vertical scalability.
Discuss techniques like load balancing, caching, and CDN (Content Delivery Network).
Consider techniques for optimizing database queries and reducing latency.

## Fault Tolerance and Reliability:

Design for fault tolerance and resilience.
Discuss strategies like redundancy, replication, failover, and graceful degradation.
Implement health checks and monitoring systems.

## Security:

Design security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Discuss authentication, authorization, encryption, and data privacy.
Implement measures for securing data in transit and at rest.

## Monitoring and Logging:

Design logging and monitoring systems for tracking system health and performance.
Discuss tools and techniques for monitoring metrics and generating alerts.
Consider centralized logging and distributed tracing.

## Testing and Deployment:

Discuss testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
Design deployment strategies for rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and canary releases.
Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) for deployment.

## Cost Optimization:

Discuss strategies for cost optimization, including resource provisioning, auto-scaling, and usage-based pricing models.
Consider cloud provider services and their pricing models.

## Future Considerations:

Discuss potential future requirements and how the system can accommodate them.
Consider technological advancements and their impact on the system.

## Trade-offs:

Discuss trade-offs made during the design process, such as consistency vs. availability, performance vs. cost, and simplicity vs. flexibility.

## Conclusion:

Summarize the key design decisions and rationale behind them.
Address any open questions or concerns.
